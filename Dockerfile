# llama-swap for AMD GPUs — ROCm + Vulkan in one image, built from source
#
# The same shape as ghcr.io/mostlygeek/llama-swap:unified-vulkan (binary names
# in /usr/local/bin, config at /etc/llama-swap/config/config.yaml, models in
# /models, port 8080) so a config written for that image works here, but built
# from plain ubuntu:24.04 with no upstream image in the chain. Everything in it
# is compiled here from the projects' current default branches:
#
#   - llama-swap itself, from source (LLAMA_SWAP_COMMIT + the open upstream PRs
#     in LLAMA_SWAP_PATCHES, web UI embedded) and vllm-wrapper from the same
#     tree -- so an open llama-swap PR ships in THE llama-swap binary, not as a
#     side binary.
#   - llama.cpp from current master + the open upstream PRs in LLAMA_PATCHES
#     (Vulkan fusions, Qwen fixes, qwen4exp MTP, adaptive MTP, checkpoint
#     restore, ... -- the list with rationale is at the LLAMA_PATCHES arg), the
#     SAME tree for the Vulkan and the ROCm build. There is no un-patched
#     llama.cpp in the image any more: llama-server IS the patched build.
#   - the ROCm userspace runtime (HIP runtime, rocBLAS/hipBLAS + Tensile
#     kernels, hipBLASLt, rocminfo) from AMD's apt repository
#   - HIP builds of llama.cpp, whisper.cpp and stable-diffusion.cpp, installed
#     as *-rocm binaries next to the Vulkan ones:
#       llama-server-rocm, llama-cli-rocm, llama-tts-rocm, llama-bench-rocm,
#       whisper-server-rocm, whisper-cli-rocm, sd-server-rocm, sd-cli-rocm
#   - EngramHalo.cpp (Aristo94's Strix Halo/qwen4exp fork of llama.cpp, HIP,
#     gfx1151 only) as *-engram binaries -- see the WITH_ENGRAM arg below
#   - LaurentZuijdwijk's llama.cpp fork (Vulkan) as *-fpx binaries: it adds the
#     ROCmFPx weight formats (ROCmFP4 & co., GGUF types stock llama.cpp cannot
#     load), kernels tuned for the batch widths speculative decoding verifies
#     at, and adaptive draft sizing -- see the WITH_FPX arg below
#   - OUR OWN fork (SelfRef/llama.cpp-rdna3) as *-rdna3 binaries: the same
#     ROCmFPx base plus the unupstreamed RDNA3/RDNA3.5 Vulkan patches we have
#     measured on gfx1100/1101/1151 -- see the WITH_RDNA3 arg below
#   - Vulkan builds of llama.cpp, whisper.cpp, sd.cpp and audio.cpp with a
#     MODERN glslc. Upstream builds them on Ubuntu 24.04 with its stock glslc
#     (shaderc 2023.8 / glslang 14), which cannot compile the
#     GL_EXT_integer_dot_product and GL_EXT_bfloat16 shaders, so llama.cpp's
#     CMake silently drops those code paths (the device line at startup shows
#     "int dot: 0 | bf16: 0" even though RADV advertises both). The integer
#     dot path is the fast quantized prompt/matvec path on GPUs without
#     cooperative-matrix support (q8_1 MMQ for K-quants: ~2x pp on RDNA2 in
#     upstream's numbers, DP4A flash attention for q8_0/q4_0 KV caches, MMVQ
#     decode); on coopmat GPUs (RDNA3+) llama.cpp keeps its FP16 coopmat
#     matmul for prompts, so measured on an RX 7900 XTX the rebuild is
#     neutral for prompt speed (+~2% decode) -- there the big win is the
#     newer Mesa below. We build on the Ubuntu 24.04 ABI but with glslc taken
#     from the Ubuntu 26.04 pocket (see vulkan-builder), and verify at build
#     time that the extensions are compiled in, so nothing is silently left
#     out for any GPU.
#   - llama.cpp (both backends) built with GGML_BACKEND_DL +
#     GGML_CPU_ALL_VARIANTS: the CPU backend is compiled once per x86 feature
#     level and the best one is picked at runtime, so a single image gets
#     AVX2 on Zen 3 (e.g. 5950X) and AVX-512/VNNI/BF16 on Zen 4/5 (e.g. Strix
#     Halo) for CPU-offloaded experts. Upstream ships one generic AVX2 build.
#   - llama.cpp ROCm built with GGML_CUDA_FA_ALL_QUANTS so flash attention has
#     kernels for every K/V cache type combination; without it only q8_0/q8_0
#     and q4_0/q4_0 stay on the GPU and e.g. q8_0/q4_0 falls back to the CPU
#     (upstream issue #27761: pp512 drops ~68%).
#   - sd-server with its web UI embedded (upstream builds it without, see the
#     sd-frontend stage).
#   - audio.cpp's server and CLI (Vulkan, as upstream) PLUS its GGUF converter
#     audiocpp_gguf (upstream ships no converter), all from one tree so the
#     converter's model-spec catalog matches the server that loads its output.
#   - a current Mesa/RADV from the kisak PPA instead of Ubuntu 24.04's.
#
# Why not FROM the upstream image any more: once llama-swap is built here the
# base contributed one apt line, two audio.cpp binaries and three commit
# hashes -- and cost ~650 MB per pull in binaries that were deleted in a child
# layer but still shipped in the parent layers, plus a daily base rebuild that
# invalidated every final-stage layer whether or not anything relevant changed.
# Nothing of upstream's docker/unified is vendored either: the entrypoint is
# llama-swap itself (defaults in CMD, so container arguments replace them).
#
# Versions: every project is built from the ref in its *_COMMIT arg (default:
# the current default branch). Because nothing in the build context changes
# between scheduled runs, CI resolves those refs to commits first
# (scripts/resolve-refs.sh) and passes them as build args -- a moved branch is
# then a cache miss for exactly the stages that use it. A local
# `docker buildx build .` resolves per stage at build time (fine on one
# machine; use `$(scripts/resolve-refs.sh --docker)` to pin). Everything that
# was built, with the PRs merged, is recorded in /versions.txt.
#
# Layout: llama.cpp is installed as self-contained directories
# /opt/llama-vulkan, /opt/llama-rocm, /opt/llama-engram, /opt/llama-fpx and
# /opt/llama-rdna3
# (binaries + their shared libs, RPATH $ORIGIN, ggml backends discovered next
# to the executable) with symlinks in /usr/local/bin, so the builds never
# share a libggml.
# whisper/sd/audio.cpp binaries are static.
#
# Build:
#   docker buildx build -t llama-swap-rdna .
#
# Run (container is root, so no --group-add is needed for device access):
#   docker run -it --rm --device /dev/kfd --device /dev/dri \
#     --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
#     -p 8080:8080 -v $PWD/models:/models llama-swap-rdna
#
# See README.md for build args, GPU support and runtime env vars.

# ── llama-swap ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Revision of mostlygeek/llama-swap to build llama-swap and vllm-wrapper from

# days and the open PRs below are written against it.
ARG LLAMA_SWAP_COMMIT="main"

# Open upstream llama-swap PRs merged on top, same rules as LLAMA_PATCHES
# (closed PRs are skipped with a notice, conflicts fail the build). Empty since

# ── ROCm ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# ROCm source channel. AMD now ships ROCm through two repositories:
#   multiarch (default) — repo.amd.com/rocm/packages-multi-arch/ubuntu2404:
#     the current releases (ROCM_SERIES, e.g. 7.14 -> apt picks 7.14.1), split
#     into per-gfx packages, so the runtime image carries BLAS kernels only
#     for AMDGPU_TARGETS (~50 MB per arch) instead of the classic ~6 GB
#     all-arch rocBLAS/hipBLASLt Tensile blobs. Installs under
#     /opt/rocm/core-<series>/, symlinked back to the classic /opt/rocm
#     layout in the stages below.
#   classic — repo.radeon.com/rocm/apt + the rocm/dev-ubuntu-24.04 builder
#     images: tops out at 7.2.4 (checked 2026-09-01) and carries the HIP
#     graphs bug fixed in 7.13 (needs GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_GRAPHS=1, see
#     llama.cpp discussion #27950). Kept as a fallback.
ARG ROCM_CHANNEL=multiarch

# classic channel only: builder image tag + apt repo path.
ARG ROCM_VERSION=7.2.4

# multiarch channel only: the release series embedded in the package names
# (amdrocm-runtime7.14, amdrocm-blas7.14-gfx1151, ...); apt then resolves the
# newest point release of that series. Bump when AMD publishes the next one.
ARG ROCM_SERIES=7.14

# Build the ROCm side at all? true = full image (Vulkan + ROCm runtime + *-rocm
# binaries); false = Vulkan-only image, the HIP builder stages are not even
# started (BuildKit only builds stages the final one references). CI publishes

ARG WITH_ROCM=true

# gfx architectures compiled into the HIP binaries: RDNA2 (gfx1030), RDNA3/3.5
# (gfx1100/01/02, gfx1150/51), RDNA4 (gfx1200/01) -- the consumer/APU cards this
# image is for. The CDNA data-center targets of llama.cpp's official ROCm image
# (gfx908;gfx90a;gfx942) are left out: they cost ~30% of an already long CI
# build (all-quant FA kernels x every target) and Instinct users have AMD's own
# containers; add them back here if needed. GPUs not listed can still use the
# Vulkan binaries.
ARG AMDGPU_TARGETS="gfx1030;gfx1100;gfx1101;gfx1102;gfx1150;gfx1151;gfx1200;gfx1201"

# Ubuntu release whose glslc/libshaderc1 are installed into the (24.04) Vulkan
# builder. Only those two packages come from it (per-package release selection
# + low pin), everything else stays 24.04 so the binaries run on the runtime
# image's glibc. 26.04 "resolute" ships shaderc 2026.1 / glslang 16.
ARG GLSLC_SUITE=resolute

# Newer Mesa (RADV, the Vulkan driver) for the final image. Ubuntu 24.04's
# stock Mesa 25.2 is a year behind; kisak-mesa tracks the current stable
# release (26.1 at the time of writing). Measured on an RX 7900 XTX with the
# SAME Vulkan binaries: pp512 693 -> 856 t/s (+24%), decode unchanged, and the
# newer RADV exposes VK_VALVE_shader_mixed_float_dot_product (fp16 "dot2").
# Set to "" to keep Ubuntu's stock Mesa.
ARG MESA_PPA="ppa:kisak/kisak-mesa"

# ── llama.cpp ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# llama.cpp revision for BOTH llama.cpp builds (Vulkan and ROCm): sha, tag,
# branch, or refs/pull/N/head. Default: current master, so that the open PRs
# below apply and the image carries the newest backend work.
ARG LLAMA_COMMIT="master"

# Upstream llama.cpp pull requests merged on top of LLAMA_COMMIT, for BOTH
# backends, as a space-separated list of PR numbers (fetched over git as
# refs/pull/N/head and merged in list order; the .patch endpoint is
# rate-limited on CI runners). A PR that is closed on GitHub (merged or
# rejected) is skipped with a notice; one that no longer merges cleanly FAILS
# the build, so drift is never a silent no-op. Dry-run the whole set with
# scripts/checkout-with-prs.sh on a local clone before changing it.
#
# This used to be two builds -- a "pure" llama-server with only #27952 and a
# llama-server-next with the full set -- merged into one on 2026-09-06: the
# full set had been the one actually serving models, and none of the PRs
# touches CUDA/HIP sources, so the ROCm build takes the same tree. Set on

# Trimmed on 2026-09-09 against master d4abd573 (dry-run merge of the whole
# list; the two dropped PRs were FATAL for the build, not optional):
#   retired as merged upstream: #28024, #27220, #28253 (and #28068 on 09-06).
#   #27952 (int8 coopmat1) DROPPED -- no longer merges (conflict in
#          ggml-vulkan.cpp). It is the one with measured value on RDNA3
#          (pp512 +4.6% dense / +18.5% MoE; qwen36 server prefill 850 -> 1098
#          t/s on 08-29), so PUT IT BACK the moment it merges upstream (it has
#          an approval) or rebase it into patches/. Until then MoE prefill on
#          this box is ~15% lower than the 09-06 image.
#   #28136 (lazy PLE direct reads) DROPPED -- no longer merges (conflict in
#          tools/llama-bench/llama-bench.cpp). NOTE this removes the
#          `--lazy-mode on-direct` VALUE from llama-server: master only has
#          on/auto/off, so any config using on-direct fails to start (the
#          cloud repo's qwen38-flash entry was moved to `--lazy-mode on` in
#          the same commit). Measured throughput-neutral with a warm page
#          cache -- it only optimises cold start.
# Revised 2026-09-10 against master df03399b (dry-run merge of the whole list,
# scripts/checkout-with-prs.sh on a local blobless clone -- all eight merge
# cleanly, so this list is what the build will actually apply):
#   retired as merged upstream: #28457 (small-M matmul, merged 09-10) and
#          #28330 (no indexer V cache, merged 09-10). #28422 (topk_moe fusion
#          for prefill), the one that had to be left out on 09-06, and #25773
#          are in master too.
#   #27952 RESTORED -- see above. It is the reason this revision exists: with
#          prefill (not decode t/s) the thing being optimised since 09-10, it
#          is the only patch with a measured pp win on this card, and MoE
#          prefill (qwen36, ling3) has been ~15 % down since it was dropped.
#   #28489 (MMVQ path selection) DROPPED -- no longer merges (conflict in
#          ggml-vulkan.cpp, 09-06 head vs current master). Its measured value
#          was +2-5 % MoE *decode*, nothing on prefill, so it is not worth a
#          local rebase; re-add if the author refreshes it.
#   #28092 (server --cache-disk, a prompt cache that survives a process
#          restart) EVALUATED AND LEFT OUT: it conflicts with #25592 in
#          tools/server/server-context.cpp and #25592 is the bigger TTFT win
#          here (exact-position checkpoint restore, 35 s -> 1.3 s). Worth
#          revisiting when either side rebases -- with llama-swap swapping
#          processes on this box, a disk-backed prompt cache is the one
#          remaining structural prefill saving.
# Retired as merged upstream: #28068 (GDN norm max->rsqrt, merged 2026-09-06).
# Measured and NOT adopted: #28528 (Vulkan stream-k MUL_MAT: the shaders exist
# for cm1 but the heuristic only enables them on coopmat2/NVIDIA, so it is a
# no-op on RADV RDNA3 -- revisit if the cm1 gate lands), #28611 (RDNA3 L-tile
# warp micro-dimension, +62 % pp on gfx1151: gated to UMA/iGPU on purpose and

# top of master 38a5b42d + the seven PRs above + patches/28243-rebased.patch,
# all clean). Nothing here is measured on this box yet -- this is the
# "full experimental" set, and every entry is a candidate for removal if the
# post-build benchmark says so:
#   #25666 (NOW CARRIED AS patches/25666-rebased.patch, see the 2026-09-18
#          revision below) Vulkan: do NOT enable MMVQ for speculative-decode
#          steps on AMD. A spec step evaluates n = 1 + n_draft, which trips
#          the "n > 1 means a batch" early-out in ggml_vk_should_use_mmvq()
#          and takes the MMVQ path, where the Q8_1 activation quantization
#          neither amortizes at that n NOR keeps the logits identical -- so
#          it lowers draft ACCEPTANCE as well as speed. gfx1151, 35B-A3B MoE
#          + MTP @33k: TG 75.2 -> 84.9 t/s (+12.9 %), acceptance 72-75 % ->
#          83-85 %, prefill unchanged. Applies to the stock-Vulkan MTP
#          entries (qwen38-bart, -hau, -hui); NOT to qwen38-fast (fpx fork
#          takes no PRs) and NOT to qwen38-flash (HIP). Only gfx1151 data
#          exists upstream -- the author is asking for discrete-GPU numbers,
#          which this box can produce.
#   #28927 context: drop the sched_need_reserve from set_causal_attn(). The
#          causal flag only changes KQ mask CONTENTS, not graph topology, and
#          allow_reuse() already compares it. mtmd toggles it twice per image
#          chunk and each toggle forced a full scheduler reserve (new sched +
#          worst-case graph + compute buffers) -- hundreds of ms at high n_ctx,
#          two per video frame. We serve vision at ctx 32768. One line.
#          (#28751 is the same idea and #28872 a broader variant -- one only.)
#   #28956 Vulkan correctness: a mul_mat reading a slice of a larger cache took
#          the head stride from the visible row count instead of the tensor, so
#          every head but the first read the wrong data (repairs the Qwen3 AR
#          --no-fa path). Does not obviously explain any of the three RADV
#          qwen35-* faults that moved those entries to ROCm on 09-15, but it is
#          the same neighbourhood (cache views) -- keep it in the tree for that
#          re-test.
#   #28876 server: allow RANK pooling to split prefill across physical batches
#          for causal-decoder rerankers (Qwen3). Today a rerank document larger
#          than one physical batch simply does not work, which is why the
#          qwen3-rerank entry carries --ubatch-size 8192; with this, that
#          workaround can go and documents may exceed 8192.
#   #28901 MERGED UPSTREAM 2026-09-16 and REMOVED FROM THE LIST 2026-09-18
#          (it is in master now; the checkout script had started skipping it
#          with a "closed on GitHub" notice). Kept here for the reasoning:
#          qwen4exp fused hyper-connection ops (gated hc_pre, null-comb
#          hc_post). MATTERS FOR HIP, NOT VULKAN: it adds ggml-cuda/dsv4-hc.cu
#          with both variants templated and leaves the CUDA supports_op alone,
#          while its Vulkan hunk REJECTS both new variants (gate param != 0,
#          src[3] == nullptr), so the auto_fhc probe turns the fusion off on
#          Vulkan and those entries keep the unfused path. qwen38-flash runs
#          llama-server-rocm, so it is the one that can win here. Upstream
#          numbers are CPU-only (pp2048 +14 % on a DGX Spark). Keeps the
#          build_hc_mix()/build_hc_combine() signatures and gates the fused

#   #28943 HIP: skip fully masked KV tiles in the AMD WMMA flash-attention
#          path (#28495). Improves HIP PREFILL when server slots share a
#          unified KV cache, which since 2026-09-15 is qwen38-flash
#          (--parallel 2) plus all three qwen35-* entries (--parallel 4) that
#          moved to llama-server-rocm. Brand new, no reviews, and it changes FA
#          math -- verify OUTPUT, not just t/s, before trusting it.
# LOCAL VERIFICATION 2026-09-15 (both stages built here, not on CI:
# `docker build --target llama-vulkan .` and `--target llama-rocm
# --build-arg AMDGPU_TARGETS="gfx1100;gfx1101"` -- 176 s and ~7 min on this
# box, vs hours of runner time, so test the merge set this way BEFORE pushing):
#   both stages compile clean, including #28901's new ggml-cuda/dsv4-hc.cu
#   under HIP and #28943's fattn-mma-f16.cuh changes.
#   Binaries run from the :full runtime image (stage images have no Mesa ICD):
#   - Vulkan: a greedy completion is BYTE-IDENTICAL to the shipped build.
#   - #28876 CONFIRMED FIXED: a 1608-token rerank document at --ubatch-size 512
#     is refused by the shipped build ("input is too large to process") and
#     scored by this one. The qwen3-rerank entry's --ubatch-size 8192 can go.
#   - HIP qwen4exp (qwen38-flash flags, ctx 8192): loads, output byte-identical
#     to the shipped build, DRAFT ACCEPTANCE 0.714 / mean len 3.14 -- so the
#     rebased #28243 patch works end to end (draft head + Q8_0 sidecar).
#   - #28943's path (4 slots on one unified KV, FA on, HIP): coherent output.
#   - #28901 is ACTIVE ON HIP ONLY, confirmed in the merged source: the CUDA/HIP
#     supports_op takes DSV4_HC_PRE with the gate param and DSV4_HC_POST with a
#     null comb, which is exactly what Vulkan rejects.
#   NOT measured: every speed number. Decode t/s on a GPU shared with the live
#   stack scattered +-20 % run to run (qwen35-2b 50-72 t/s on BOTH builds), so
#   #25666 and #28901 need `benchmark` on a quiet box, not a smoke test.
# Looked at and deliberately NOT added on 2026-09-15:
#   #28092 (--cache-disk) refreshed 09-14 and merges into master again, but
#          STILL conflicts with #25592 in tools/server/server-context.cpp on
#          our tree -- the 09-10 trade is unchanged, #25592 is the bigger win.
#   #28528 (stream-k MUL_MAT) touched 09-15 but is still enabled for coopmat2
#          only: the cm1 shaders exist, the author declines to tune the cm1
#          heuristic on NVIDIA hardware. Still a no-op on RADV -- and an
#          opening for someone with an XTX to tune it.
#   #28415 / #28440 (IQ4_XS MMQ/MMV) rebased + "optimize" on 09-15 with
#          NOTHING addressing the RDNA3 degenerate output the 09-09 bisect
#          found here (never reported upstream -- worth filing).
#   #28849 (auto-fit tries model ctx x parallel slots under unified KV) -- not
#          a win, a behaviour change: every entry here runs --fit on with
#          --parallel 2/4 against huge native contexts, so it can start picking
#          much larger contexts and reshuffling experts. Watch it land.
#   #25483 (skip unneeded MoE work in the coopmat1 path) measured +0.3 % here
#          on 09-06; not worth the rebase burden.
# Revised 2026-09-15 against master 38a5b42d, after the CI build failed:
#   #28243 (qwen4exp MTP) was DROPPED FROM THE LIST here and carried as
#          patches/28243-rebased.patch, because master had moved the
#          grouped-norm gammas (hc_*_norm, ple_norm_*) from a flat [hc_dim]
#          tensor to [n_embd, hc] + TENSOR_ALLOW_RESHAPE while the PR rewrote
#          the same lines to load them with MTP-aware flags. RESTORED TO THE
#          LIST 2026-09-18, in its original slot after 27952: the author
#          rebased the PR that day and it merges clean again, so the local
#          patch is gone (see patches/README.md). Note it had ALREADY gone
#          stale against master 5b335f413 -- its src/llama-arch.h hunk no
#          longer applied -- so this was a second latent build failure, not
#          just tidying. This is the MTP draft head qwen38-flash runs on.
# Revised 2026-09-18 after the CI build failed (run 35354559401). Verified by
# building the llama-vulkan stage locally against master ec9281505, which is
# newer than the 5b335f413 the failed run pinned:
#   #25666 (Vulkan MMVQ / spec-decode) DROPPED FROM THE LIST and carried as
#          patches/25666-rebased.patch instead. The PR itself has not moved
#          since 2026-08-26 -- master drifted under it, and GitHub marks it
#          CONFLICTING upstream too. The conflict is pure placement, not
#          substance: master deleted the "// Device tuning" comment that the
#          PR's first hunk anchors its new MMVQ_MAX_DECODE_LIKE_N constant to,
#          so git had nothing to attach the insertion to; the other three hunks
#          still auto-merge. The rebased patch is byte-for-byte the PR's own
#          four-hunk diff, re-anchored -- nothing was reinterpreted. Verified
#          2026-09-18: every other PR in the list merges clean on ec9281505,
#          this is the only one that does not. Drop the patch and
#          put #25666 back in the list the moment the author rebases it.
#          STILL UNMEASURED on this box (see the 09-15 note) -- if `benchmark`
#          does not show the gfx1151 gain on an XTX, delete it rather than
#          carrying a patch for nothing.
# Revised 2026-09-24:
#   #27952 (int8 coopmat1 MMQ) RETIRED -- merged upstream (70c4e1582), so
#          master carries it now. Its final form folds in #28440 (IQ4_XS cm1)
#          and brings #28415 (IQ4_XS MMQ/MMV) along with master, the pair that
#          produced subtly broken UD-Q4_K_XL output on RDNA3 on 09-09 -- check
#          the text, not only t/s, on any IQ4_XS-bearing quant.
#   #28943 (HIP masked-KV-tile skip) RETIRED -- closed without merge on 09-22
#          (the maintainer asked for a human redesign).
# patches/*.patch (local rebased patches) apply after the merges to both

# ── ROCmFPx fork (LaurentZuijdwijk/llama.cpp) ──────────────────────────
# A SECOND Vulkan llama.cpp install (/opt/llama-fpx, *-fpx binaries) from
# LaurentZuijdwijk's fork of llama.cpp, which upstream cannot replace because
# it adds new GGUF tensor types:
#
#   - the ROCmFPx weight formats (Q4_0_ROCMFP4 / _FAST / Q2/Q3/Q6/Q8_0_ROCMFPX,
#     ggml type ids 100-107, hand-ported from ciru-ai/ROCmFPX <- charlie12345/
#     ROCmFPX where the format originates) with CPU codecs plus Vulkan dequant,
#     mat-vec, matmul and integer-dot kernels. Stock llama.cpp cannot LOAD these
#     files at all (`Q4_0_ROCMFP4_FAST` is GGUF file type 103).
#   - a reworked batch-3..8 mat-vec path (whole-block MMVQ for the FP4 types,
#     branch-free fp6/fp3 dequant, an IQ3_S register-spill fix) -- exactly the
#     widths speculative decoding verifies at.
#   - `--spec-draft-adaptive` / `--spec-draft-n-min`: draft length follows the
#     measured acceptance rate instead of a fixed `--spec-draft-n-max`.
#   - Vulkan prefill tuning that also pays on stock K-quants: an LDS bank-conflict
#     fix in the coopmat matmul tile stride (driver-gated to RADV >= 25.3), f16 B
#     operand for quantized matmul/matmul_id, a tiled concat-transpose for the
#     delta-net conv state.
#
# Measured on an RX 7900 XTX (gfx1100, RADV/Mesa 26.2.2, 2026-09-09) -- Qwen3.8-27B with its
# baked MTP head, greedy prose / json / refactor decode t/s:
#   stock llama-server, unsloth UD-Q4_K_XL (16.35 GiB), n-max 3
#       60.9 / 83.6 / 94.7   prefill 423 / 328 / 777   VRAM 22.3 G  PPL 6.637
#   llama-server-fpx, julianmb ROCmFP4-FAST (13.55 GiB, 4.25 bpw), n-max 4
#       76.7 / 105.5 / 128.0 prefill 457 / 343 / 921   VRAM 19.0 G  PPL 6.921
# i.e. +26 / +26 / +35 % decode and -3.3 GiB for +4.3 % perplexity. The FP4
# format is a software codebook, NOT hardware FP4 (no RDNA GPU has FP4 matrix
# instructions): the decode win is bytes moved per token plus those batch-3..8
# kernels. On the same card the fork's engine work alone, on the same K-quant
# file, is +5-7 % prefill and neutral decode -- so the file, not the binary, is
# where most of it comes from; both are needed.
#
# Vulkan-only on purpose: the fork ships no HIP kernels for these types. It is
# built in BOTH published tags (nothing here needs the ROCm runtime). The fork
# tracks upstream by merging master periodically, so it lags a few weeks; keep
# `llama-server` the default engine and use this one per config entry.
#
# THIS STAGE APPLIES NO PRs, and it cannot: LLAMA_PATCHES is merged into the
# upstream tree only. Measured 2026-09-10 -- the fork's master last merged
# upstream at 0190529e (2026-08-30), and merging current master into it gives
# 11 conflicts (ggml-vulkan.cpp, vulkan-shaders-gen.cpp, llama-kv-cache.cpp,
# llama-memory-hybrid-idx.*, qwen4exp.cpp, dflash.cpp, convert_hf_to_gguf.py,
# test-backend-ops.cpp, tools/ui/CMakeLists.txt). Merging a single PR head is
# no better: the head carries master with it, so it hits the same conflicts.
# Consequence to keep in mind when reading benchmark rows: the entries on
# `llama-server-fpx` (i.e. qwen38) get NONE of the Vulkan prefill work in
# LLAMA_PATCHES or in recent master -- #27952, #28457 and #28422 all miss them.
# The fork's own engine work is still ahead of stock on this card (+15.2 % on a
# 32k prompt, 2026-09-10), so the answer is to watch the fork for its next
# upstream merge, not to hand-rebase it here.

# ── RDNA3 fork (SelfRef/llama.cpp-rdna3) ───────────────────────────────
# OUR fork of ggml-org/llama.cpp, built as a FOURTH Vulkan llama.cpp install
# (/opt/llama-rdna3, *-rdna3 binaries). Created 2026-09-18 because the two
# things this hardware needs have never been in one tree:
#
#   - the ROCmFPx weight formats (as in the fpx stage above), which upstream
#     does not carry and probably will not until 0cc4m's #28898 lands FP8/NVFP4
#     quant scales in ggml;
#   - a set of RDNA3/RDNA3.5 Vulkan patches that were written against upstream,
#     measured, and then NEVER submitted -- they exist only as patch files
#     passed between community forks (voidsurfer/llama.cpp-nudge <- Nathan
#     Wilson's strix-halo-vulkan, plus Gaetan Puleo's server fixes).
#
# The fpx stage can host neither: it tracks someone else's fork, which cannot
# take LLAMA_PATCHES (11 conflicts, see above) and whose owner decides what it
# carries. This one is ours: branch `rdna3` = the ROCmFPx base with the patches
# we have measured on OUR cards, rebased on our schedule, every patch on its own
# `carry/*` branch so one bad upstream rebase does not take the rest with it.
#
# Targets, and the reason for the name: gfx1100 (RX 7900 XTX), gfx1101
# (RX 7800 XT) and gfx1151 (Strix Halo / Ryzen AI Max+ 395) -- one architecture
# family (RDNA3 + RDNA3.5). Nothing else is accepted into the branch.
#
# Like the fpx stage this is Vulkan-only and applies NO upstream PRs YET: the
# branch is still based at the fork point (upstream 0190529e, 2026-08-30) so PR
# heads do not apply. Moving that base up -- and with it finally getting
# LLAMA_PATCHES *and* FP4 in ONE binary -- is the point of owning the fork, and
# it is a re-port, not a rebase: #25773 rewrote matmul pipeline creation and
# #28732 split the Vulkan sources. Do it in steps, benchmarking each one.
#
# ALWAYS build with RDNA3_COMMIT pinned -- scripts/resolve-refs.sh resolves it for
# you. The clone happens inside a RUN whose cache key is the ARG VALUES, so a
# build that passes only RDNA3_BRANCH silently reuses the layer from whatever the
# branch pointed at last time: measured 2026-09-18, a rebuild after a force-push
# returned the PREVIOUS tip's binary and reported the old commit in
# /versions.txt. The same trap applies to FPX_BRANCH and ENGRAM_BRANCH.
# Pass the FULL 40-char sha, never an abbreviation: the clone is a
# `git fetch --depth=1 origin <ref>`, and GitHub rejects a short sha in a want
# line -- the stage then fails with a bare `exit code: 128`. The same canaries as the fpx stage guard it: if a rebase ever drops the
# ROCmFPx types or adaptive drafting, the build FAILS instead of shipping a
# plain llama.cpp under the -rdna3 name.

# multiarch: plain Ubuntu 24.04 + the dev packages from

# for these releases). Everything lands under /opt/rocm/core-<series>/; the
# classic layout is symlinked back so ROCM_PATH=/opt/rocm and the cmake
# configs keep working. amdrocm-runtime-dev pulls the HIP headers/cmake and
# the LLVM toolchain (amdclang++, device bitcode); blas-host/-dev +
# hipblas-common-dev provide librocblas/libhipblas(lt) with headers and cmake
# configs for ggml-hip's find_package(hipblas/rocblas); solver-host provides
# librocsolver, which libhipblas.so references since 7.14 (static links fail
# without it and the runtime needs it on the NEEDED chain); amdrocm-base has
# rocminfo/rocm_agent_enumerator. There is no hipconfig here — HIPCXX and
# HIP_PATH are exported instead and the build scripts prefer them when set.

# layout is /opt/rocm/core-<series>/ symlinked to the classic paths, and
